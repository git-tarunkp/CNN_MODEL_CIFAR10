# CIFAR-10 Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can achieve high accuracy in classifying these images.

# Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes are:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
The dataset is already divided into training and test sets, and the images are pre-labeled.

# Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed to classify the images into the 10 categories. The architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers
Pooling Layers
Fully Connected Layers
Dropout Layers (for regularization)
Softmax Activation (for the output layer)

# Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 71.85% on the test dataset after 4 epochs of training.
